# Remark Preset Obsidian

Remark preset to recreate Obsidian-flavored markdown.

Includes existing plugins like:
- [`remark-gfm` (Github-flavored markdown)](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
- [`remark-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter)
- [`remark-math`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math)

And introduces a new plugin:
- `remark-highlight` (to add support for highlighted text with the `==syntax==`)

And it introduces support for something close to [obsidian-citation-plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin)
- [`remark-cite`](https://github.com/benrbray/remark-cite)
- `remark-bibliography` (which adds a bibliography section based on pandoc-style citations, e.g., `[@hoogland2022]`)
